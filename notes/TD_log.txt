I had a problem with enemies having problem reaching their attack spot when there was already a horde of other enemies blocking their way. Navmesh agents dont take other agents into account.

note: to activate, call NavModifier.SetAreaClass(NavArea_Null) and to deactivate pass NULL parameter instead
