11.1.
I had a problem with enemies having problem reaching their attack spot when there was already a horde of other enemies blocking their way. Navmesh agents dont take other agents into account.

solution: add NavModifier component to enemies and activate it when enemy reches its attack spot. 

note: to activate, call NavModifier.SetAreaClass(NavArea_Null) and to deactivate pass NULL parameter instead
